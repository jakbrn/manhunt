# Manhunt City Game App

This app is designed for playing the city game **Manhunt**. It allows the game host to track the runner's location and share it with hunters at intervals set by the host. Only the host needs to have an account; other players can join as guests.

## Features

- **Live Location Tracking:** The runner's location is updated and shared with hunters at a configurable interval.
- **Host Controls:** The host sets the location update interval and manages the game session.
- **Guest Access:** Hunters and runners can join the game as guestsâ€”no account required.
- **Easy Setup:** Quick start for new games and seamless joining for players.
